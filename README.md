# Open-Source-SAST
What is SAST? 
SAST solutions may be thought of as white-hat or white-box testing, in which the tester is aware of information about the system or software program being tested, which include an architecture diagram, access to application source code, etc. SAST solution examine source code (at rest) to identify and report vulnerabilities that can cause security vulnerabilities.
Source-code analyzers can run on non-compiled code to check for defects including numerical errors, input validation, path traversals, pointers and references, and more. Binary and byte-code analyzers do the same on built and compiled code. Some solutions run on software source code only, a few on compiled code only, and a few on both.
